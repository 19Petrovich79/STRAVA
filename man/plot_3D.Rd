\title{Create 3D interactive elevation map from gpx tracklogs}
\usage{
plot_3D(
  tracklog_folder = NULL,
  cache_folder = "~/cache_plot_3D",
  elevation_scale = 6,
  elevation_scale_tracklog_corr = 0.01,
  buffer_around_tracklog_km = 1,
  render_high_quality = FALSE,
  sunangle = 250,
  sunaltitude = 75,
  color_tracklog = "blue",
  color_background = "lightskyblue1",
  water_detect = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tracklog_folder}{The path to the folder of your gpx file to be read by strava::process_data().
process_data() will read all gpx files from this folder and plot_3D() will plot them all.
It is however recommended to PLACE ONLY ONE GPX file within the folder.
If the tracks cover an extended area plot_3D() can slow down significantly.
If tracklog_folder is undefined plot_3D() loads an example tracklog provided with the package.}

\item{cache_folder}{Directory to store the downloaded elevation data and overlay image for reuse}

\item{elevation_scale}{Horizontal vs vertical ratio of the plot. Could be estimated with geoviz::raster_zscale(dem).}

\item{elevation_scale_tracklog_corr}{Raises elevation_scale for the tracklog by the specified percentage.
Useful if tracklog occasionally disappears into the ground.}

\item{buffer_around_tracklog_km}{Buffer distance around the tracklog in km. Scene is cut outside this.}

\item{render_high_quality}{If set to TRUE the function downloads higher resolution elevation and overlay data.
All steps are very time and resource consuming.}

\item{sunangle}{The direction of the light source of the scene}

\item{sunaltitude}{The angle, in degrees (as measured from the horizon) from which the light originates.}

\item{color_tracklog}{Color of the tracklog on the scene.}

\item{color_background}{Color of the scene's background.}

\item{water_detect}{If set to TRUE rayshader will look for flat surfaces in the scene and render them in blue}
